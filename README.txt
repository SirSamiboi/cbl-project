Welcome to Magic Defender!

The story:

In this game, you act as the commander of a castle. A horde of monsters, led by a man known as
"The Fallen", are laying an attack on the castle, and your King has tasked you with defeating
these monsters to protect his empire. To do this, you must construct different types of magic
towers which will hold back and defeat the enemies in various ways. If you manage to survive the
attacks, The Fallen has vowed to tear the castle apart by himself. Will you manage to defeat him?

How to run:

- Open the MagicDefender folder
- Run Main.java
- Once the game is open, select "Start Game" to start a round, and enjoy :)

How to play:

- Enemies arrive in waves; survive the 15th wave and defeat The Fallen to win
- Select one of the 8 empty plots to build a tower
    - Basic towers shoot energy beams which target and damage a single enemy
    - Fireball towers shoot slow but powerful blasts that can damage multiple enemies at once
    - Chill towers cause groups of enemies to freeze and slow down
- Once a tower has been placed, it can be upgraded to improve a tower's attack damage, range, effect and/or speed
- Towers are built and upgraded with gold
- You start a round with 50 gold, you earn more by defeating enemies
- To upgrade a tower, the tower must first be clicked to be selected. This will also let you see its range of attack
- Enemies will appear from the top-left corner of the map, and will travel along the visible path
- If an enemy reaches the bottom-right corner without being defeated, you will lose lives as the castle is damaged
- If you lose all 10 lives before defeating the 15th wave of enemies, the game is lost
- Try experimenting with different tower placements to find the most efficient setup
- Once a tower has been placed, it cannot be removed, so don't place basic towers everywhere, and never begin a round with a chill tower!

Testing:

All of the game's functionality is accessed with a game round. The game can be tested by simply
starting the program and pressing "Start Game" to begin a round. Depending on the player's actions,
the game will result in either victory or defeat.
